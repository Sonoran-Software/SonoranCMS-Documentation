## I have a Starter or Plus subscription, what happens now?

### Plus Subscribers

Your plan will be automatically downgraded to the NEW Standard plan. Your account has **automatically received pro-rated credit** for the difference.

This means your community now gains access to:

* Unlimited User Accounts
* Unlimited Website Pages
* In-Game Integration Plugins
* API Access
* Discord Role Sync
* TeamSpeak 3 Sync
* Sonoran CAD Sync
* Unlimited Departments
* Unlimited Rosters
* Unlimited Forms
* Unlimited Discord Webhooks
* Branding Removal
* and so much more!

If you had a custom domain on the Plus plan, you will still have access to it for 30 days. If you wish to keep this after 30 days, you will need to subscribe to the Pro plan.

### Starter Subscribers

Your plan will be automatically downgraded to the NEW free version. Your payment method has **already been refunded a pro-rated amount** for your remaining time.

This means your community now gains access to:

* Unlimited Website Pages
* In-Game Integration Plugins
* API Access
* Discord Role Sync
* TeamSpeak 3 Sync
* Sonoran CAD Sync
* Unlimited Departments
* Unlimited Rosters
* Unlimited Forms
* Unlimited Discord Webhooks
* and so much more!

If you have a custom community ID, you will be **grandfathered** into keeping it. If you wish to update this again, you will need to subscribe to the Standard or Pro plan.
