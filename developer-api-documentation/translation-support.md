# ðŸŒŽ Translation Support

## Setting the Language In-App

Sonoran CMS will attempt to automatically detect your local language. However, you can manually set your language preferences in the top right of your screen.

## Add or Improve Translations

Our translation support is made possible by community contributions.

To add or improve translations for your local language, submissions can be made at [translate.sonoransoftware.com](https://translate.sonoransoftware.com). Or, submit a manual PR to our [GitHub](https://github.com/Sonoran-Software/sonorancms\_translations) language repository.
