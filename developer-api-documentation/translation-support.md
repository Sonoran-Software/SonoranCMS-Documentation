# ðŸŒŽ Translation Support

## Setting the Language In-App

Sonoran CMS will attempt to automatically detect your local language. However, you can manually set your language preferences in the top right of your screen.

## Add or Improve Translations

Our translation support is made possible by community contributions.

To add or improve translations for your local language, submissions can be made at [translate.sonoransoftware.com](https://translate.sonoransoftware.com). Or, submit a manual PR to our [GitHub](https://github.com/Sonoran-Software/sonorancms\_translations) language repository.

### Improving Translations

1. Navigate to translate.sonoransoftware.com and select the "Sonoran CMS" project, then the web app and finally the language you would like to improve.
2. Select "Browse" under the "Translation status" section and enter the phrase you would like to find in the "filter" box at the top of the page.
3. Once you locate the string or strings you would like to suggest a change to, click the string.
4. Make the edits to the string in the "Glossary term" box as shown below, then click "Suggest"

Once a staff member has reviewed the suggestion it will be added to the official translations to be released with our application on the next release. Thank you for helping improve our translation accuracy.

### Adding Translations

By default, when we add verbiage to our application, we use AI to translate the English strings to all our supported languages. Sometimes AI will miss a few languages or strings. You can assist us in adding these by following a similar process to suggestions.

1. Create an account on translate.sonoransoftware.com via the "Register" link at the top of the page before proceeding.
2. Navigate to translate.sonoransoftware.com homepage and select the "Sonoran CMS" project then the "Web App". The languages with strings not translated will show in on this page with a number under the "Unfinished" column.
3. Click the number in the aforementioned column to begin translating, then click the first string.
4. Enter the translation in the empty field, then click "Save and continue", the page will move to the next unfinished string until complete.

Once a staff member has reviewed the translation it will be added to the official translations to be released with our application on the next release. Thank you for helping improve our translation accuracy.
