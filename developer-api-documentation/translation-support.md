# ðŸŒŽ Translation Support

## Setting the Language In-App

Sonoran CMS will attempt to automatically detect your local language. However, you can manually set your language preferences in the top right of your screen.

## Add or Improve Translations

Our translation support is made possible by community contributions.

If you would like to add additional support for your local language, please submit a PR to our [GitHub](https://github.com/Sonoran-Software/sonorancms\_translations) language repository. Or, join our [Discord ](http://discord.sonorancad.com/)and claim for the community development and testing role in the `#request-role` channel.
