# Development Branch

{% hint style="warning" %}
The development API and CMS branches are entirely separate from the current production version. For more information in working with our development team please [contact us](https://support.sonoransoftware.com/). or join our community [Discord](http://discord.sonorancad.com/).
{% endhint %}

## Rate Limiting <a href="#rate-limiting" id="rate-limiting"></a>

Sonoran CMS' development branch maintains the same rate limiting as production. However, rate limits only result in a one minute block as opposed to an hour.

## Development API Server <a href="#development-api-server" id="development-api-server"></a>

All API endpoints and requests should be made to the following address:

```
https://cmsapi.dev.sonoransoftware.com
```

## Development CMS <a href="#development-cad" id="development-cad"></a>

The latest CMS development version can be accessed at the following address:

```
https://cms.dev.sonoransoftware.com
```

## Development Subscription - Free <a href="#development-subscription-free" id="development-subscription-free"></a>

Data will be reset at random times and **this environment is not suitable for production use**. Use only for testing new features when requested by Sonoran Software Development and for developing API based resources.
