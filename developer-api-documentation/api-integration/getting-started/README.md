## Gather Your Credentials

All API calls require some basic authentication. Here's how to find your community ID and API key.

### API ID System

To map your API calls to a Sonoran CMS account, your users must place a unique ID inside their community account settings.

{% content-ref url="api-id-system.md" %}
[api-id-system.md](api-id-system.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
