Community Events allow you to organize and plan events for your community to further engage with your members. Events allow you to plan the start & end time, title, description and an optional header image for each. Events also allow your members to RSVP to track who's attending your event.

#### Regarding RSVP Limit

Setting the RSVP Limit from anything but -1 will restrict the total RSVP spots available, setting it to -1 will allow for an unlimited spots for RSVP.

## Discord Integration

If you have linked you community to our [Discord Bot](https://info.sonoranbot.com/en/tutorials/getting-started), creating an event in CMS will automatically create an event within your community's Discord channel making it easy to coordinate community events across multiple platforms!

By clicking the `Interested` button, you will be automatically RSVP'd in CMS.
