## Manually Join with a Community ID

Users can [create an account](registering-your-account.md), and click the blue arrow **Join** button on the main page.

* Enter the [Community ID](../customization/community-branding-and-settings.md#community-id-and-vanity-url)
* Press **Enter** to search
* Select the community to join

From there, users can select your community card in the **My Communities** section to log into your CMS.

## Join Community with a URL

### Vanity URL

All communities are given a free [vanity URL](../customization/community-branding-and-settings.md#community-id-and-vanity-url) formatted as `<communityid>.sonorancms.com`. This URL will directly load your community homepage, allowing users to login and join.

### Custom Domain

Communities with a **Pro** subscription can [link a custom domain](../customization/custom-domain.md#custom-domain). This custom domain name will load the community homepage, allowing users to login and join.
