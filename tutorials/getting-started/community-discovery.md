Discovering and joining new communities is made simple with Sonoran CMS, when joining a community through the discovery portal you'll be greeted with the community's new member application, this will allow you to be streamlined into community's application process!

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all communities will have the default new member application form set, if none is set you will be redirected to the community's dashboard upon join.
{% endhint %}

## Configuring Community Discovery

Head to your Community Customization, locate the Administrative Panel > Customization > Customization. Expand the "Community Discovery" item, this will display all active settings your community has with Community Discovery.

Once enabled your community will be shown to the thousands of users that use Sonoran CMS through the Community Discovery portal. You can also set a "New Member Application" form to be automatically shown when a user joins your community through the discovery portal.
