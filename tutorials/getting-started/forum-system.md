The Sonoran CMS Forum System is a custom page element allowing you to create and organize your forum(s) to fit the needs of your community. Easily add Forum Categories to any custom page, create or use existing categories across multiple pages. Each category has the ability to manage permissions to **Create a Topic**, **Remove Topics**, and **Remove Topic Replies**.

**Note:** Currently all members of your Sonoran CMS community will have access to view and reply to all topics in categories they can access through custom pages. Additional permissions are planned.
{% endhint %}

### Creating Forum Categories & Adding Forum Elements

To create a Forum Category navigate to the Custom Page Editor located at Administrative Panel > Customization > Custom Page Editor. Once you've located the editor, add a **Forum Section** to your Custom Page.

Now that you added a Forum Section you can select from existing Forum Categories or create a new one. If you're looking to create a category, simply click the blue **CREATE** button. This will display a popup with various inputs, fill in the category label and select the permission preferences that apply. Once the category fits the needs that you like click the green outline **SAVE** button.

To view forum topics navigate to a Custom Page that has a Forum element added. Once you've located a page you will be shown a table with all of the topics in the forum category. Click the topic table row to open up the topic for viewing and replying.

To create a forum topic simply click the green plus button located on the Forum Topics table, this will display a topic creation dialog. Fill in the appropriate information for the topic you're wanting to create. Once the topic information suffices your needs simply click the green outline **CREATE TOPIC** button to create the topic. Once it's created it'll automatically navigate you to the topic. This will allow you to edit and reply to the topic.
