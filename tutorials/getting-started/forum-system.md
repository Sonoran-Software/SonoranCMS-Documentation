The Sonoran CMS Forum System is a custom page element allowing you to create and organize your forum(s) to fit the needs of your community. Easily add Forum Categories to any custom page, create or use existing categories across multiple pages. Each category has the ability to manage permissions to **Create a Topic**, **Remove Topics**, and **Remove Topic Replies**.

**Note:** Currently all members of your Sonoran CMS community will have access to view and reply to all topics in categories they can access through custom pages. Additional permissions are planned.
{% endhint %}

### Creating Forum Categories & Adding Forum Elements

To create a Forum Category navigate to the Custom Page Editor located at Administrative Panel > Customization > Custom Page Editor. Once you've located the editor, add a **Forum Section** to your Custom Page.

Now that you added a Forum Section you can select from existing Forum Categories or create a new one. If you're looking to create a category, simply click the blue **CREATE** button. This will display a popup with various inputs, fill in the category label and select the permission preferences that apply. Once the category fits the needs that you like click the green outline **SAVE** button.

Once you have saved the Custom Page you can now view the page with the Forum element added.&#x20;

### Viewing & Creating Topics

To view forum topics navigate to a Custom Page that has a Forum element added. Once you've located a page you will be shown a table with all of the topics in the forum category. Click the topic table row to open up the topic for viewing and replying.

To create a forum topic simply click the green plus button located on the Forum Topics table, this will display a topic creation dialog. Fill in the appropriate information for the topic you're wanting to create. Once the topic information suffices your needs simply click the green outline **CREATE TOPIC** button to create the topic. Once it's created it'll automatically navigate you to the topic. This will allow you to edit and reply to the topic.

### Topic Actions: Pin & Lock

To improve the organization of your forum, you can pin and lock topics. Pinning a topic will move it to the top of the forum category, and locking a topic will prevent any new replies from being added. You can access these options by right-clicking on a topic from the list view, or by using the buttons next to the edit and remove options while viewing a specific topic. These features will help keep your forum organized and on-topic.

### Dedicated Forum Category Page

To get a complete view of all the topics in a specific forum category, you can navigate to its dedicated page. This page can be shared with other members through a link, so they can easily access it as well. You can access the dedicated page without having to use a custom page element, so it's quick and easy to view all the topics in a particular category.

To view the dedicated page for a particular forum category, first locate the custom page forum element that contains that category. Then, click on the category's name at the top-left corner of the topics table. This will take you to the dedicated page for that category, where you can see all of the topics it contains.
