There are two ways to view a community profile, both options are listed below. One of which is accessing a profile through a roster or through the administrative panel.

## Accessing a Community Profile via Administrative Panel

Accessing a Community Profile via the Administrative Panel is easy as viewing the Accounts panel on the Administrative Panel. Once you're on that panel you can right-click any table row which will provide you with two options, "Edit Account Information" and "View Member Profile". Select "View Member Profile", which will direct you to the user's community profile.
