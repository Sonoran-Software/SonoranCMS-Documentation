## Accessing a User's Community Profile

There are a few ways to view a community profile, which are listed below.&#x20;

From `Administrative Panel` > `User Accounts`, you can right click on any user, then select `View Member Profile`.&#x20;

You can also click on any user's account avatar to be redirected to their profile. This can be done from the `User Accounts` page when viewed as a grid, from the `Edit Account Information` popup, as well as from form submissions, forum posts, and any other places where a user's avatar may be displayed.
