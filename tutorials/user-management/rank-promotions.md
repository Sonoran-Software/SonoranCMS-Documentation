# Rank Promotions

## What are Promotions?

**Promotion flows** let you easily promote or demote members within your community.

For example, a user with the **Rookie** rank can be promoted to **Member**, or an **Administrator** can be demoted to **Moderator**.

## Creating Promotion Flows

### Label and Ranks

1. **Access the Promotions Panel**\
   In the **Promotions** panel, select **Promotion Flows** to view, add, edit, or remove existing promotion flows.
2. **Set Up the Flow Header**\
   Use the **Promote From** and **Promote To** fields to label the flow.\
   **Example:** Promote from **Moderator** to **Admin**.
3. **Configure Rank Changes**
   * In the **Ranks to Add** section, select **Admin**.
   * In the **Ranks to Remove** section, select **Moderator**.
4. **Run the Promotion Flow**\
   When executed, this flow will **add the Admin rank** and **remove the Moderator rank**, effectively promoting the user.

## Running Promotion Flows
