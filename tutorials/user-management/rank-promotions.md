# Rank Promotions

## What are Promotions?

Promotion flows make it easy to promote or demote users in your community. For example, someone with the rank of `Rookie` and be promoted to `Member`. Or, someone with the rank of `Administrator` could be demoted to `Moderator`.

## Creating Promotion Flows

### Label and Ranks

In the **Promotions** panel, select **Promotion Flows** to view, add, edit, and remove promotional flows.

In the flow header, label the flow with the **Promote From** and **Promote To** inputs. For example: we want to promote from **Moderator** to **Admin**.

In the **Ranks to Add** section, we will select the **Admin** rank. In the **Ranks to Remove** section, we will select the **Moderator** rank.

When this flow is ran as a promotion, it will add the **Admin** rank and remove the **Moderator** rank.

### Actions

When a promotion flow is ran, you can also run automated actions like a Discord webhook, push notification, and more.

## Running Promotion Flows

### Via CMS

In the **Run Promotions** panel, select the user(s), promotional flow, and whether you wish to promote or demote.

You can use the green **+** icon to create additional rows, running multiple different promotional flows at once.
