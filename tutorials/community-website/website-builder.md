### Basic Information

From the website builder's toolbar you can change the page's title, path slug, and privacy setting. Additionally, you're able to add new sections, change the preview size of the editor to visualize different size settings, and toggle the borders for the different sections of your page.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CMS_WebsiteBuilderHead.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sonoran CMS - Webpage Toolbar</p></figcaption></figure>

The borders can be useful for visualizing the size of different sections on the page and will not show up on the viewable version of the page.

### Section-Specific Styling

With recent updates to the Custom Page Editor you're now able to customize the margin, padding, gutter, alignment and background styling of sections.

**Padding:** Padding refers to the space between an element's content and its border. It can be used to increase the visual space around a section, or to create separation between sections on a page. In your page editor, you can change padding options for different areas, such as top, bottom, left and right.

**Margin:** Margin refers to the space outside an section. It can be used to create space between sections on a page or to push elements away from the edges of the page.  In your page editor, you can change margin options for different areas, such as top, bottom, left and right.

**Horizontal alignment:** Horizontal alignment refers to the positioning of a section horizontally within the page. It can be used to center a section or align it to the left or right side of its container. In the page editor, we offer horizontal alignment options such as "start", "center", "end", "around", "between", and "evenly" to allow users to adjust the horizontal alignment of their section.

**Vertical alignment:** Vertical alignment refers to the positioning of an section vertically within the page. It can be used to align an element to the top, middle, or bottom of its container. In the page editor, we offer vertical alignment options such as "top", "middle", or "bottom" to allow users to adjust the vertical alignment of their section.

**Gutters:** Gutters refer to the space between elements in a section. They can be used to create visual separation between elements or to adjust the overall layout of a page.

It's important to note that the use of padding, margin, and alignment can greatly affect the design and layout of a page, so it's important to use them thoughtfully and consistently throughout your design. I hope this explanation helps your users better understand these concepts.

### Element Sizes, Alignment and Background

Using the three align buttons, different size settings and background options you are able to control the styling of said element.

These three size options; Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile are all different widths your element can have while being under those specific screen size conditions. You can preview how the size changes depending on settings by exiting the element edit modal and switch between the preview size selector above in blue.

### Buttons

If you wish to add buttons to your page, you can add a button or button group section to your page. Each button has several settings that define how the button looks like and acts. Each button can be direct users to external websites, custom forms and custom pages.

Button elements can have individual styles and button group elements can have all group styles.

## Privatized Pages

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Private Pages will have customizable permissions in the Department Editor
{% endhint %}

Pages can now be privatized and require permissions to view. When editing a page, you can select whether the page is public (and can thus be viewed by anyone in the community) or private.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CMS_WebsiteBuilderTopBtns.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sonoran CMS - Visibility Button</p></figcaption></figure>

If it's set to Private, you can use the dropdown to the right to select what ranks are allowed to view this page.

## Default / Landing Page

Sonoran CMS allows you to easily customize the landing page/dashboard for your community, this page is the first page your members will see from signing into your community. This allows the full customization of a custom page for your landing page.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CMS_WB_DefaultHomepage.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sonoran CMS Custom Page as Dashboard Page</p></figcaption></figure>

To set a Custom Page as your homepage, navigate to the main page for the Website Builder and look under the section titled `Website Pages`. Locate the page you wish to use as your homepage and press the grey home button, this will turn it orange and set it as the landing page.

## Custom Page Paths

Custom Pages can now have a custom path to the page, this path will append to the Sonoran CMS URL. If you're using a custom domain it'll detect that and provide the proper URL.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CMS_WB_Slug.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sonoran CMS - Page URL Slug</p></figcaption></figure>

## Custom Domain

Sonoran CMS allows you to display your community website [on your own domain](../customization/custom-domain.md)!

## Toolbar

Sonoran CMS allows you to [customize the top toolbar](toolbar-customization.md) with buttons to link your users to whatever your community needs.
