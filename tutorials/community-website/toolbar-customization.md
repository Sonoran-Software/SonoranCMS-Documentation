# Toolbar Customization

Sonoran CMS allows you to customize the top toolbar with buttons to link your users to whatever your community needs.

To customize your community's toolbar head over to the `Administrative Panel` > `Website Builder`. From there you can add buttons, dropdowns and community image with various options.

To add a new button or dropdown, click the green plus button to add it to the end of your toolbar, or drag-and-drop the button to whatever position within the toolbar you'd like.

If you would like to reorder items in the toolbar, simply drag-and-drop them into their new position.

Each button and drop down option has a label and link associated with it, with these set they will be displayed to all community users.

If you make any changes, it will automatically save.

## Toolbar Item Permissions

Toolbar items that lead to permission-restricted areas (such as private pages or admin panels) automatically show or hide based on whether the user has access to the destination.

Access to specific toolbar link destinations can be configured in the [rank manager](../user-management/creating-departments.md).
