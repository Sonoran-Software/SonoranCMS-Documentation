# Discovery

## Community Spotlight

The community discovery system highlights both active, growing small communities and large communities with many members. Communities in the spotlight are also advertised in the [CAD](https://info.sonorancad.com/why-choose-sonoran-cad/about), CMS, and [radio ](https://info.sonoranradio.com/why-choose-sonoran-radio/why-choose-sonoran-radio)main menus.

All of these metrics are based off the last seven days.

### üìàFastest Growing Community

This category is based on user growth as a percentage and is limited to communities between `50` and `250`  members.

_Improve your ranking in this category by_ [_signing up new members_](../../getting-started/inviting-users-to-your-cms.md) _in your community._

### üëÄHighest Website Traffic

This category is based off the number of unique user visits to the homepage per day.

_You can improve your ranking in this category by using CMS as your_ [_primary website_](../../community-website/website-builder.md)_. Both visitors and members count towards traffic._

### üë•Most Active Community

This category is based off of the number of unique user logins in your community per day.

_You can improve your ranking in this category by having your members utilize your CMS website more frequently. Using a_ [_custom domain_](../../customization/custom-domain.md#custom-domain)_, running all_ [_applications/forms_](../../forms/) _via CMS, utilizing online CMS_ [_forums_](../../community-website/forum-system.md)_, etc._

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏èMost Recently Bumped Community

This category randomly selects communities that have been bumped in the last hour.

_You can improve your ranking in this category by bumping your community in the discovery panel._

_Bumped communities are also posted to the #advertise-here channel in our_ [_Official Discord_](https://discord.sonoransoftware.com)_!_

## Discovery Metrics

Every time your community is viewed or clicked on via the community discovery page, or CAD/CMS/radio menu those metrics are logged.

You can view these in the growth panel to see how the community spotlight and discovery page are impacting your community.
