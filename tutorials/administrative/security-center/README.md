# Security Center

## Account Flags

Advanced alternate account detection keeps your community safe from bad actors and previously banned users.

{% content-ref url="account-flags.md" %}
[account-flags.md](account-flags.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Logging Center

In-depth logging of all user actions in your CMS help keep your community safe from bad actors!

{% content-ref url="logging-center.md" %}
[logging-center.md](logging-center.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



Located at `Administrative Panel` > `Security Center`,  the Security Center allows you to monitor your communities logs, as well as view account flags (coming soon).&#x20;

You can filter the logs by `Type`, `Date`, and by the `Account` associated with a log.
