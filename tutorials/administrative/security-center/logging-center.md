## What is the Logging Center?

The logging center allows administrators to search and find historical user actions in their CMS community. If a user maliciously deleted a document or updated a webpage, it's easy to find out who and when!



## Accessing the Logging Center

The logging center is located in the `Administration Panel` > `Security Center`

### User Permissions

Users will need the `Security Center` permission under the `System` tab in the [rank manager](../../user-management/creating-departments.md).

### Searching Logs

Logs can be searched and filtered by the `type`, `user`, and `date` of occurrence.

All logs are stored for 30 days, regardless of your subscription tier.
