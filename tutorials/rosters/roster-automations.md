# Roster Automations

## Roster Trigger Actions

Communities can use the [**Actions**](../administrative/actions.md) panel to send webhooks, in-game messages, and other automated tasks. These actions can run on a schedule or be triggered when roster cells change.

**Example:**\
A community roster includes a **Status** column that automatically switches members between **Active** and **Inactive** based on their recent in-game activity. When a member’s playtime drops below the required threshold and their status updates to _Inactive_, a Discord webhook should be sent automatically.

## Edit Roster on Form Stage

When a form is moved to a new stage a roster cell can be automatically updated.
