To manage Calendar Categories navigate to `Administrative Panel > Customization > Customization`. This is where you can add, remove and update categories. You'll be able to customize the name and color for each category.

To edit a Calendar Category, simply click the category tag above the inputs. This will populate the inputs with the category's data. You can save the category with the green button to the right of the inputs.

To remove a Calendar Category, simply click the "X" button on the category tag.

These categories are accessible in the Community Calendar to create events from!
