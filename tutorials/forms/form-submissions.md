# Form Submissions

## Submitting a Form

The available applications page lists all forms that the user has permissions to submit.

Select `Submit Form` to create a new form submission.

### Third-Party Form Submissions

You can also submit forms in reference to or on the behalf of other users with the `Submit 3rd Party Application/Form` permission.

To do this in the form submission, simply select their user in the dropdown menu labeled `You are submitting this form under`.

Toggling the bell icon will notify this user that a form has been submitted under them.
