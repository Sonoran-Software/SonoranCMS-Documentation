# Managing Forms

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyDLlEtGS9w" %}

The "**Admin Delete**" permission granted under the "**Forms**" permission section allows users to delete and manage deleted forms. Once a form is "deleted" it will no longer be recognized in the system as "valid", these "deleted" forms are filtered separately from all other forms.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Admin Delete** is a separate permission for each form template, this is not a global permission for all forms.
{% endhint %}

Deleting & Managing Deleted Forms is all handled through the **Form Management Panel**, simply manage a form by right clicking the form's row in the table. This will allow you to either **Delete** or **Undo Delete** a form depending on what state is currently is in.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a "**Patrol Log**" type of form is deleted it will no longer be calculated with the rest of the "patrol logs" for hour calculation.
{% endhint %}
