Discovering and joining new communities is made simple with Sonoran CMS, when joining a community through the discovery portal you'll be greeted with the community's new member application, this will allow you to be streamlined into community's application process!

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all communities will have the default new member application form set, if none is set you will be redirected to the community's dashboard upon join.
{% endhint %}

## Configuring Community Discovery

To begin setting up community discovery, locate the `Administrative Panel` > `Customization`. From here, click on the `Community Discovery` tab along the left-hand menu.

Once enabled your community will be shown to the thousands of users that use Sonoran CMS through the Community Discovery portal. You can also set a "New Member Application" form to be automatically shown when a user joins your community through the discovery portal.
