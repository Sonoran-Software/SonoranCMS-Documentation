## View Your Page

Once your page is created and saved, a dropdown will appear on the dashboard showing all community pages. In this dropdown, you can select the page you want to open it up

All pages are public, you can copy the URL after going to a page and share it with anybody, they don't even have to be part of the Sonoran CMS community!

## Page Editing

To start editing a page, either add a new page or edit an existing page in the page editing admin menu.

In the HTML editor, you are able to write or insert your own HTML code that wouldn't be possible using the default editor.

## Toolbar

Custom pages can be setup as links from toolbar items

To setup links to community pages, go to `Admin` -> `Customization` -> `Toolbar Customization`. Create the button you'd like to see, check "Community Page Link," and select the page you want
