Profile Fields allow communities to put direct information onto member's profiles that can be restricted to certain viewers, editors, etc. with rank permissions. Profile Fields are dynamically on profiles depending on what ranks the profile you're viewing holds.

Easily create and edit profile fields to your liking to fit your community's needs. Each field can be customized to have a different type and label with more to come in the future.

### Creating Profile Fields

To start creating profile fields go to the Administrative Panel > Customization > Profile Fields Editor.

Once you've located the editor you can start by clicking the green **New** button, this will enable the creation process. From here you'll customize the label, type, and options (if you have chosen the field type of **select**).

If you choose the field type of **select** you'll be required to enter at least one option, once you type in an option press **Enter** on your keyboard and a new option will be added.

Once you're satisfied with the customizations you made to the field you can click the orange **Save** button.

Now that you've created a field you'll want to move onto the next section detailing the permissions associated with fields.

### Managing Profile Field Permissions

Profile Field Permissions are essential to managing your fields for your members, permissions create "settings" for each field that accounts abide by when viewing profiles. Understanding these permissions will allow you to better leverage the use of Profile Fields.

Navigate to the Administrative Panel > Customization > Department Manager.

Select the rank that you'd like to edit and review the permissions below while selecting which permissions you'd like to grant to the rank.
