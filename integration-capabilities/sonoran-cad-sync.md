### 3. Map CAD Permissions to Ranks

To edit, click any rank on the left-hand side. This tree will contain all department and ranks that your community currently has. Enable all permissions you want to grant to the individual with this rank. When you're done setting up CAD Sync and configuring permission mappings, simply close out of the window by clicking the red X button and it will automatically save your credentials, settings, and trigger a mass sync of all permissions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Permission syncs from Sonoran CMS will set the user's permissions explicitly to what is mapped in the CMS and will wipe any non-enabled permissions.
{% endhint %}
