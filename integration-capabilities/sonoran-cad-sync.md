### 4. Map CAD Permissions to Ranks

To edit, click any rank on the left-hand side. This tree will contain all department and ranks that your community currently has. Enable all permissions you want to grant to the individual with this rank.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Permission syncs from Sonoran CMS will set the user's permissions explicitly to what is mapped in the CMS and will wipe any non-enabled permissions.
