### 4. Server Config

Add the following to your `server.cfg`

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is very important that the sonorancms\_updatehelper resource is **not** started manually. Doing so may cause a server crash if updates are available due to a race condition.&#x20;

**DO NOT** start the whole \[sonorancms] folder as that will also start the sonorancms\_updatehelper which might cause crashing if it is started manually.&#x20;

Example of what **not** to do: `ensure [sonorancms]`
{% endhint %}

```javascript
exec @sonorancms/sonorancms.cfg
```

### 5. Configure Submodule Features

The CMS Core resource comes with a variety of submodules included by default. These handle a variety of features such as whitelisting, permission synchronization, and more.

## Updates

Sonoran CMS's core will automatically update with the latest features, fixes, and changes!

## Troubleshooting

### Server Crashes

Check to make sure `sonorancms_updatehelper` is not being started in your server.cfg.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is very important that the `sonorancms_updatehelper` resource is not started manually. Doing so may cause a server crash if updates are available due to a race condition.
{% endhint %}

### Ensure your resource is up-to-date and download the latest release.

CMS updates are released often. Make sure your server is running on the latest release.

### Ensure your API ID is set correctly.

If your community is using recommended Discord integration, ensure your [Discord account](https://info.sonoranbot.com/en/tutorials/getting-started/sonoran-cms-integration#h-1-discord-sso-linking) is linked.

For other methods (Steam, FiveM License, etc.) ensure you have set your [API ID in the CMS](../../../developer-api-documentation/api-integration/getting-started/api-id-system.md) using the API ID that your community is looking for.

### Yarn Error

Some users will see this in their server console:

```
[ script:yarn] Error: [yarn] error @discordjs/collection@1.5.3: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=16.11.0". Got "16.9.1"
[ script:yarn] Error: [yarn] error Found incompatible module.
[ script:yarn] [yarn] info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/install for documentation about this command.
[ citizen-server-impl] Building resource sonorancms failed.
[ citizen-server-impl] Error data: yarn failed!
```

In the case of this error, please locate the file named `.yarn.installed`, open it in any editor, then save it (without modifying anything).&#x20;

This updates the "date modified" value for that file, which should then allow it to build correctly.
