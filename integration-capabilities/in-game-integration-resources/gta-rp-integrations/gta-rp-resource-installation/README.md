# GTA RP Resource Installation

## Installing a Resource

This uses the whitelist resource as an example.

### 1. Download

Download the resource from its repository. These are found under its resource page, like here for the whitelist resource.

### 2. Extract

{% hint style="warning" %}
All plugins for FiveM require the [Core](../available-resources/core.md) to start.
{% endhint %}

Extract the resource to your server resources folder in the folder named [sonorancms] that comes with the download of Core so it sits alongside sonorancms & sonorancms_updatehelper.

### 3. Add resource to server.cfg

Add `ensure sonorancms` to your server.cfg and restart your server!
