# Resource Troubleshooting

## Quick Checks

### 1. Ensure your community is on a paid version.

Your community's subscription may have expired and failed to renew. Do a quick check on your [community limits](../../../../tutorials/administrative/view-your-limits.md) to make sure your community version includes the resource you are trying to install.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each resource install guide lists the required subscription version at the top.
{% endhint %}

### 2. Ensure your resource is up-to-date and download the latest release.

Resource updates are released often. Make sure your server is running on the latest release.

### 3. Ensure your API ID is set correctly.

If your community is using recommended Discord integration, ensure your [Discord account](https://info.sonoranbot.com/en/tutorials/getting-started/sonoran-cms-integration#h-1-discord-sso-linking) is linked.

For other methods (Steam, FiveM License, etc.) ensure you have set your [API ID in the CMS](../../../../developer-api-documentation/api-integration/getting-started/api-id-system.md) using the API ID that your community is looking for.
