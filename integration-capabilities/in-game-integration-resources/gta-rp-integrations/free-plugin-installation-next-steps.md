# Free Plugin Installation - Next Steps

![Sonoran Servers - Bundle Program](<../../../.gitbook/assets/banner\_update-1 (1).png>)

If you haven't already, [check out our page for more information on this promotion](../../../pricing/pricing-faq/free-plugin-installation-and-discount-sonoran-servers.md).

## 1. Locate your Installed Plugins

Every CMS addon resource installed will have a separate folder. These are located in the `\resources\[sonorancms]` directory.

## 2. View and Change Configuration Files

For every Sonoran CMS addon installed, there will be a `config.lua` or `config.json` file present.

You can open these configuration files with a text editor and change values.

For more information on a plugin's configuration options, you can view the individual plugin guides on the [Available Resources](../roblox-integrations/available-resources/) page and scroll down to the configuration section.

If you modify a configuration file, be sure to save it and restart the server.
