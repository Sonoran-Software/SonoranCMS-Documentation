3.  Input the TeamSpeak group permanent ID into the **TeamSpeak Group ID** input

    * A TeamSpeak's group ID can be found by hovering over it in the permission editor
    * Additionally, if you have Sonoran Radio installed you can also follow [this guide](https://info.sonoranradio.com/en/tutorials/permissions#server-group-ids)

Repeat this for all ranks you'd like to map to a TeamSpeak Group

Once you've setup the rank mapping, you can save by clicking **Save Integration Settings**. This will automatically sync everyone who has their TeamSpeak setup

## Setting up Your Users

For users in your community to benefit from this feature, they must setup their TeamSpeak UID after you've setup your connection. Check out this guide for adding your UID to CMS:
