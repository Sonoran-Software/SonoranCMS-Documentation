## Managing Job Sync

Select the rank(s) which you would like to associate with a given job in-game on the left box, then select the job in the right box.

When a player has the job in-game, they will be granted the associated CMS ranks. This allows you to restrict permissions for Sonoran CAD, Radio, etc. to specific character jobs only.

Click `ADD` to add that mapping to the Job Sync list. Repeat for however many jobs you need to sync. If needed, you can delete a mapping with the red trash button on the right.
