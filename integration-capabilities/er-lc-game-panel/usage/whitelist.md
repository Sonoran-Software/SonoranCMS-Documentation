# Whitelist

## Social Requirements

The `Social Requirements` section allows you to require that CMS accounts be linked to both Discord and Roblox accounts. When users have both social accounts connected, the ER:LC panel and Discord integrations can operate with full functionality.

### Enabling Social Requirements

Toggle the `Roblox` and/or `Discord` requirement(s). Then, define custom actions to trigger when a user joins your ER:LC panel without having a linked Roblox or Discord account in the CMS.

Available actions include public or private in-game messages, Discord webhooks, push notifications, and more.

## Allow and Deny List

The allow and deny lists let you control game access based on CMS ranks. These lists are activated once one or more ranks are configured.

When enabled, only users with a Roblox account linked to a CMS account that holds an **allowed rank** can join the server. Users without an allowed rank will be kicked automatically.

If a user’s CMS rank appears on the **deny list**, that restriction overrides the allow list — those users will be kicked upon joining.

## Team, Vehicle & Livery Restrictions

The Team, Vehicle, and Livery Restrictions panel allows you to control which ER:LC teams, vehicles, and vehicle liveries players can access based on their CMS ranks. Select the badge icon next to a team, vehicle, or livery to configure which CMS ranks are permitted access.

Then, you can define automated actions for users who access a team, vehicle, or livery without the required ranks.\
Available actions include removing them from the team, sending messages, triggering Discord webhooks, and more.
