# CMS Integrations

## Roster Activity Time

The ER:LC panel extends functionality to [CMS rosters](../../../tutorials/user-management/creating-custom-rosters.md) by allowing you to add an `Activity Tracker Hours` column that automatically displays each userâ€™s in-game time over a configurable period. This column can also be configured to track time spent on specific ER:LC team(s).

## Routine Actions

The [CMS Actions panel](../../../tutorials/administrative/actions.md) performs routine actions at custom intervals. This panel integrates with the ER:LC panel to offer automated in-game hints and notifications.

## Disciplinary Points

[Disciplinary points](../../../tutorials/administrative/disciplinary-panel.md) can be assigned either through an [ER:LC player record](player-records.md) or manually in the CMS. Once a user exceeds a defined point threshold, the associated disciplinary actions are executed automatically.

The ER:LC panel extends this functionality by enabling automated kicks or bans when a user reaches the configured disciplinary point limit.
