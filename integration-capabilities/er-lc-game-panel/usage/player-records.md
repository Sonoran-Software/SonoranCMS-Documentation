# Player Records

## Creating Player Records

### Via CMS Panel

New player records can be created directly from the ER:LC server dashboard.

* **Kick** and **Ban** records automatically execute the corresponding in-game commands.
* **Disciplinary Point** records add a specified number of points to a user and can be used for warnings or punishments.
* **Note** records allow staff to store important information or observations about a player.

### Via Discord Bot

Player records can be added via [Discord bot](../../discord-bot-integration.md) by using the `/erlc record` command.

* **ServerID** specifies the ER:LC server you wish to add this player record to.
* **Player** is a selected Discord user or Roblox user ID.
  * Players must [have their Discord linked](../installation.md#id-3.-link-roblox-and-discord-to-cms) for this to work!
* **Type** is the type of player record (kick, ban, disciplinary, note, etc.)
* Additional inputs may be needed for reasoning, points, etc.
