# Shifts and Activity

## Timeclock

Timeclock shift types are configured in the community customization panel.

### Via In-Game Command

Users can clock in or out of their timeclock by using the `:log` command in-game.

Format: `:log clockin [shift type - optional]`&#x20;

### Via Discord Command

Users can clock in or out of their timeclock by using the `/clickockin <type` and `/clockout` commands in Discord.

## Activity Time

When a user joins the ER:LC game server, an automatic activity timer starts. This timer captures a start and stop time log based on your team. These time logs can be [displayed on a roster](cms-integrations.md#roster-activity-time), or be shown in one of the integrations below.

## Discord Activity

### Discord Shift Reports

When a player exits the ER:LC server, a shift report will automatically be direct messaged to them via Discord.

These notifications can be disabled in the CMS notification settings.

### Discord Activity Review

Users can review their activity logs with the `/activity <type>` Discord command. This allows you to review manual timeclock shifts or automatic activity time logs.
