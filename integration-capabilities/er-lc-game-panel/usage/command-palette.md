# Command Palette

## Running ER:LC Commands

Select `Run Command` on the panel to open up the ER:LC command palette. Here, you can select a command, player(s), enter additional information, and execute the command.

Some commands have two states (e.g., Jail/Unjail, Admin/Unadmin). Simply click the command badge again to toggle between states.

The `Kick` and `Ban` command will create a [corresponding player record](player-records.md) when used.
