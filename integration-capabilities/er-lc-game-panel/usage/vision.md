# Vision

## What Is ER:LC Vision?

CMS Vision for ER:LC lets users hover over a player’s in-game name, press a keybind, and instantly open an overlay displaying that player’s latest activity with the ability to create [custom records](player-records.md) on the spot. By eliminating the need to leave the game to access or manage records, it streamlines workflows and significantly reduces response time.

## Using Vision

### Vision Settings

<details>

<summary>Keybinds</summary>

Vision keybinds and other settings are available under **Community Settings** > **Vision**

By default, the vision keybind is **Command/Control + Shift + O**. This can be customized by clicking on the keybind to record, pressing a new keybind combination, and clicking to save it.

<summary>Capture Zone</summary>

Vision captures a small area around your cursor to detect and search for usernames. The capture box can be adjusted in size and vertically offset from the cursor for precise alignment. Use the eye icon to preview the exact dimensions and position of the capture area in real time.

<summary>Server Selection</summary>

The CMS ER:LC panel supports configuring multiple servers under a single community. By default, Vision selects the first server in the list. If your community has multiple servers configured, a server selection option will appear in the Vision settings—make sure to choose the server you are currently playing in to ensure accurate data.
