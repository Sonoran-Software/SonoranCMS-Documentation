# Moderation

## Priority Player List

The Priority Player List highlights in-game users with specific CMS ranks by moving them to the top of the player list. This is useful for quickly identifying which staff members (or other ranks) are currently online.

Players with one of the configured CMS ranks will display a rank badge on their player card and appear at the top of the dashboard list.

## Username Moderation

Even with Roblox’s built-in username moderation, some inappropriate names can still bypass filters. The Username Moderation panel allows you to automatically kick users with “All” or “Others” in their username — preventing commands targeting them from affecting the entire server.

You can also configure AI-based moderation standards to automatically detect and handle inappropriate usernames.
