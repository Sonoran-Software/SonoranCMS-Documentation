# Dashboard

The ER:LC game panel's dashboard provides basic server information at a glance.

## Online Players

Quickly glance at your online players, or use the search bar and team filters to find a specific one.

### Priority Player Ranks

Players with [configured priority CMS ranks](moderation.md#priority-player-list) will appear at the top of the list. Their CMS rank icon will be displayed at the top left of the avatar and can be hovered over for more information.

Players who recently [had a command ran on them](command-palette.md) will be displayed at the top of the player list with a badge reflecting the command.

### Player Connection Time

On each player card, a clock icon will show the current connection time. Player time can also be automatically shown on a [community roster](cms-integrations.md#roster-activity-time).

### Player Actions

Clicking on a player opens a modal with more information and player actions. Here, you can kick, ban, or add disciplinary points. Additionally, you can view their linked Discord account and Roblox profile.

#### Player Recent Activity

The `Activity` expansion area will show all recent player logs and records. Click the orange icon to change between viewing all activity and viewing [player records](player-records.md) only.

#### Player Vehicle

The `Vehicle` expansion area will show the player's current vehicle in-game.
