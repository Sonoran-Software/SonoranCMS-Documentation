# Commands Reference

{% hint style="warning" %}
All commands are done via the **slash command** feature.

SonoranBot will not respond to mentions or message-based commands.
{% endhint %}

By default, only server administrators (those with Administrator in the guild) can execute any of the below commands. You must use [Discord's permissions setting feature](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots) to give users access.

Most settings can be controlled from the menu within `/settings`, you can read about all the different features within it in the [Sonoran Bot documentation](https://info.sonoranbot.com/en/tutorials/getting-started/community-management).
